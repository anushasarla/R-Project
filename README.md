# R-Project
**Project**: Analysis of Netflix and IMDb ratings, and Student Performance Data

**Project Overview**:
This project involves analyzing two datasets:

cleanDataTVFlat.csv – A dataset containing Netflix and IMDb engagement metrics.

student-mat.csv – A dataset focusing on student performance in mathematics, sourced from a school.
The project uses R to clean, manipulate, and visualize data, uncovering trends in viewer engagement and student performance.

**Key Features**:
1. Netflix and IMDb Data Analysis: 
Cleaned and processed the dataset using R libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2.
Explored average IMDb ratings across genres and content types.
Created visualizations to examine engagement metrics and trends in viewer behavior.

2. Student Performance Data Analysis: 
Imported the student-mat.csv dataset, which includes student demographic, academic, and behavioral information.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing student math performance.
Applied transformations to clean the data and handled missing values.
Built visualizations to examine relationships between study time, parental education, and final grades.

3. Data Manipulation: 
Split multi-genre entries in the IMDb data into individual rows for more detailed analysis.
Grouped and aggregated data to calculate average ratings for genres and content types.
Analyzed student performance using categorical and numerical variables, exploring correlations.

**Technologies Used**:

Programming Language: R

Libraries: readxl, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, tidyverse

**How to Use**:

1) Clone the repository and download the datasets (cleanDataTVFlat.csv and student-mat.csv).
2) Run the provided R Markdown or script files to replicate the analysis.
3) Explore the visualizations and findings for insights into media engagement and academic performance.
